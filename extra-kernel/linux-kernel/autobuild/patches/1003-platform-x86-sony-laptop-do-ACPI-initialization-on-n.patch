Subject: [PATCH 2/2] platform/x86: sony-laptop: do ACPI initialization on new
 NC devices

On new VAIO NC devices, the SSDT of them requires the EC region to be
available before the _STA method of them to return available status.

As we probe the _STA of the devices before we make EC region available,
the _INI method is not called, thus the initialization of NC device is
skipped. In these devices, _INI is used to fill the function handle
table, and its skipping will lead sony-laptop to fail to acquire
function handles.

Do the ACPI initialization by ourselves on new NC devices. The existence
of ACPI method SIRN of the NC device can be used to detect whether EC is
needed, because the EC _REG method uses it to notify NC device.
