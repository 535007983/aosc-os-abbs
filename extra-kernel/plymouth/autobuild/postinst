"\033[1;33m(!)\033[0m Plymouth is a boot splash program for your Linux desktop. Although 
the package is already installed, you will need to perform extra steps
for Plymouth to work.

1.\tGo to /etc/dracut.conf (dracut, installed as a dependency of
\tplymouth) and add the following lines to the file.

\t\tadd_drivers+=\"i915 radeon nouveau\"
\t\tadd_dracutmodules+=\"plymouth\"

\t\033[1;37mNOTE:\033[0m
\t\t* i915 for Intel graphics;
\t\t* nouveau for NVIDIA cards; 
\t\t* and radeon for AMD cards.

\t\tMultiple can be specified by need (hybrid graphics).

2.\tGo to /etc/default/grub.cfg, if you are using GRUB.
\tAdd the following line to the file.

\t\tGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT+=\" splash\"

3.\tAnd finally run the two commands:

\t\t* dracut -f to generate a new initramfs;
\t\t* grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
\t\t  to generate GRUB configuration."
