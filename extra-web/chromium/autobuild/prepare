# Value range propagation now assumes that the this pointer of C++
# member functions is non-null. This eliminates common null pointer
# checks but also breaks some non-conforming code-bases (such as
# Qt-5, Chromium, KDevelop).
#
# As a temporary work-around -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks can be
# used. Wrong code can be identified by using -fsanitize=undefined.
